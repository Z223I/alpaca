## Yahoo
- [ ] Update for increase in volume over N months average.

## Mermaid Diagram



Training wheels. No more than X positions at a time. Put it in the configuration file that would be the alpaca configuration file.

Work on filtering. May have to pass candlestick info all the way through the pipeline. Require the candle be at least 50% green and candle close be at 25% or above (H-L).Include the last three candle sticks and the current one.  I think the chart has 1 minute candles.


- [ ] For orb_alerts, get next resistance from Oracle.  No timing out. Can press <Enter> to autofix.


- [ ] Max losses per day

- [ ] When loading stocks, create stocks.json file with every stock having trading='yes'
- [ ] stop <symbol>


- [ ] Finish Daily_Instructions.md



## MACD chart to Telegram

- [ ]


## Major Resistance

- [ ] Add a major resistance field and pass it through the alerts.
- [ ] Color code major resistance in the superduper alert generator.
- [ ] Add time of day signals with green and then yellow for the afternoon



## Test new trade placement

- [ ] ~/miniconda3/envs/alpaca/bin/python execute_aapl_trade.py

## Strategies VWAP Bounce

- [X] VERY IMPORTANT. Create code/vwap_bounce_alerts.py: It is to use a watchdog to monitor the creation of new files in historical_data/YYYY-MM-DD/market_data/[symbol]*.csv; For each symbol for the current date; Take the 10 most recent candlesticks (They are 1-minute each) and combine them into two 5-minute candlesticks. Check if both candlesticks are green.  If the are both green and one of them is within 4% above VWAP, send a VWAP Bounce alert Telegram post to Bruce. It is only to send alerts during the currently configured timeframe that starts close to market open and ends at 20:00 ET.

## Daily Trade Limit

- [ ] VERY IMPORTANT.  Update lsdkfj skdj: Daily trade counts need to be saved to a dated file if the script shuts down during market hours and then restored if restarted during market hours.

## Surge

- [ ] Incoporate surge detection in daily routine.

## Squeeze

- [ ] Monitor 'premarket top gainers' for stocks that are in a squeeze.






Automatically send myself premarket top gainers and top gainers.

Momentum alerts: dial them down.



Telegram polling : integrate volume profile and volume profile bulk.




Momentum alerts: VWAP is wrong

Momentum alerts: BQ halted. On October 2. Momentum alert does not show it halted.  Look for a 90 second gap.

## Momentum Normalized

- [X] ULTRATHINK.  Update code/momentum_alerts.py: Update the Telegram message to display Momentum and Momentum Short as normalized per minute.  Show example.


## Send Top Gainers Frequency Update

- [X] THINK HARD.  Update code/momentum_alerts.py: The top gainers are currently generated once per hour for four hours.  Update the generate twice per hour for five hours.


## Send Top Gainers Update

- [X] THINK HARD.  Update code/momentum_alerts.py: After each time generating top gainers, the file name is sent to 'bruce' using atoms/telegram/telegram_post.py.  Update to send the file contents.


## Send Top Gainers

- [X] THINK HARD.  Update code/momentum_alerts.py: After each time generating top gainers, send the file to 'bruce' using atoms/telegram/telegram_post.py.


## Super Duper Alert Threshold

- [X] THINK HARD. Update atoms/alerts/config.py: trend_analysis_timeframe_minutes=20 -> 17.
- [X] 0.75 -> 0.65 in config.py

## Automatic trading

- [X] THINK HARD. Create code/configure_alpaca.py: it is to accepts args to modify code/alpaca_config.py.
Here are the args to control what account-name and account get modified:
  --account-name ACCOUNT_NAME
                        Account name to use (default: Bruce)
  --account ACCOUNT     Account environment to use: paper, live, cash (default: paper)
These are the fields that can be modified:
  auto_trade="no",
  auto_amount=100,
  trailing_percent=10.0,
  take_profit_percent=12.0,
  max_trades_per_day=1

- [X] ULTRATHINK.  Update molecules/telegram_polling.py: Only Bruce can send the command 'configure alpaca' case insensitive. It can accept the same args as code/configure_alpaca.py. It is to run code/configure_alpaca.py with the matching args. Add command to help but only for Bruce.
- [ ] THINK HARD. Review and update the polling script.  Telegram changes double hyphens. Accept single hyphens for the cli args.

## Dial Down Momentum Alerts

- [X] Update Momentum thresholds 0.70 -> 0.60.


## Momentum Alerts Updates III

- [X] ULTRATHINK.  Update code/momentum_alerts.py: Momentum and Momentum Short have the same value in the momentum alert.  I doubt that that is correct.  The Momentum should be based on 20-minutes and Momentum Short based on 5-minutes.  Suggest a fix.
- [fail] THINK HARD. Update code/momentum_alerts.py: Momentum and Momentum Short are to be normalized within there 20 and 5 minute time frames and then checked.
- [X] THINK HARD. Update code/momentum_alerts.py: Momentum = Momentum / 20; Momentum Short /= 5; Then check them against the threshold.
- [X] THINK HARD. Create code/momentum_alerts_config.py: Move the constants 20 and 5 to this file in a dataclass; Find the Momentum threshold and create three constants Momentum Long, Momentum, and Momentum Short with that value. Use the dataclass in code/momentum_alerts.py.  Momentum long is not yet used but will be.
- [X] THINK HARD. Update code/momentum_alerts.py: Review the Momentum and Momentum Short calculations.  They are to be based on minutes from the new config file.  I think they are based on the number of candlesticks.  If a stock is halted, there is not a candlestick.  Use the time please.
- [X] THINK HARD. Using the knowledge that a halted stock is missing data, update the is halted logic.
- [X] THINK HARD. Update code/momentum_alerts.py: When sending the alerts on Telegram, do not mark them as urgent.
- [X] THINK HARD. Update code/momentum_alerts.py: Use the stock volume and add a volume field to the momentum alert. Greater than 80,000 = green; less then 60,000 is a red light icon; otherwise yellow light icon.
- [X] THINK HARD. Update code/momentum_alerts.py: The stock VWAP is being used.  It is to come from the stock data. No calculation required.
- [X] THINK HARD. Update code/momentum_alerts.py: When collecting stock symbols, do not save warrants.  The end in a 'W'. Research stock warrant naming practices.
- [X] THINK HARD. Update code/momentum_alerts.py: Do not include warrant stocks.


## Orb Alerts Check If Halted Stocks Being Filtered.

- [X] ULTRATHINK.  Review code/orb_alerts.py: It has code to check if a stock is halted but, it the code being used or is it dead code?


## Momentum Alerts Updates II

- [X] THINK HARD.  Update code/momentum_alerts.py: Currently the scripts is getting a list of stocks from ./historical_data/{YYYY-MM-DD}/market/gainers_nasdaq_amex.csv.  Add to that list the stocks in data/{YYYMMDD}.csv if it exists and keep only unique symbols.


## Momentum Alerts Updates

- [X] ULTRATHINK.  Update code/momentum_alerts.py:
1) Update momentum and momentum short fields in the alert to reflect the appropriate signal light icon as defined in atoms/alerts/config.py;
2) Mirror stock is halted logic in code/orb_alerts.py to create a Python script in ./atoms/api;
3) Use the new ./atoms/api script to update the alert in code/momentum_alerts.py;
3) After creating a momentum alert, save it to historical_data/{YYYY-MM-DD}/momentum_alerts/bullish/alert_{symbol}_{YYYY-MM-DD}_{hhmmss}.json
4) After sending a momentum alert, save it to historical_data/{YYYY-MM-DD}/momentum_alerts_sent/bullish/alert_{symbol}_{YYYY-MM-DD}_{hhmmss}.json

## Market Open Top Gainers

- [X] VERY IMPORTANT. THINK HARD.  Update molecules/telegram_polling.py: Any user can send the command 'market open top gainers' case insensitive. Respond to the command by running the Python script below.  The last line of the output will contain a filename of the form ./historical_data/{YYYY-MM-DD}/market/gainers_*.csv. Return the file contents to the user that sent the command. Add this to the /help command.  Use a timeout of 15 minutes.  This script takes a while to run.
```bash
python code/market_open_top_gainers.py  --exchanges NASDAQ AMEX  --max-symbols 7000  --min-price 0.75  --max-price 40.00  --min-volume 50000 --top-gainers 20 --export-csv gainers_nasdaq_amex.csv --verbose
```


## Market Open Top Gainer

- [X] VERY IMPORTANT. THINK HARD. Mirror code/premarket_top_gainers.py. Create code/market_open_top_gainers.py: Use 1-minute candles from the previous market open to no more than market close to calculate top gainers.  This script will be during market open and sometimes after market close.


## Premarket Top Gainers

- [X] VERY IMPORTANT. THINK HARD.  Update molecules/telegram_polling.py: Any user can send the command 'premarket top gainers' case insensitive. Respond to the command by running the Python script below.  The last line of the output will contain a filename of the form ./historical_data/{YYYY-MM-DD}/premarket/top_gainers_*.csv. Return the file contents to the user that sent the command. Add this to the /help command.  Use a timeout of 10 minutes.  This script takes a while to run.
```bash
python code/premarket_top_gainers.py  --exchanges NASDAQ AMEX  --max-symbols 7000  --min-price 0.75  --max-price 40.00  --min-volume 50000 --top-gainers 20 --export-csv top_gainers_nasdaq_amex.csv --verbose
```

- [X] git switch master; merge current branch and verify that all changes are merged.
- [X] Sync changes


## Pre-market Top Gainer

- [X] VERY IMPORTANT. THINK HARD. Mirror code/alpaca_screener.py. Create code/premarket_top_gainers.py: Use 5-minute candles from the previous market close to determine top-gainers.  This must work during pre-market hours. Think about: you could collect data for the last 7 days and then use only the data from since the last market close.

## Run Volume Profile in Bulk

- [X] VERY IMPORTANT. THINK HARD. Create code/volume_profile_bulk.py: Read data/YYYYMMDD.csv for today's date;
Add a new column "POC" after the 'Signal' column;
For each stock symbol in that file run code/volume_profile.py --symbol [symbol] --days 1 --timeframe 5Min --time-per-profile DAY --chart;
From the .JSON output, read "summary":"avg_poc" and put it in the 'POC' field; and
Save the updated data as data/YYYYMMDD_POC.csv.


## Update Volume Profile

- [X] VERY IMPORTANT: Update code/volume_profile.py: Automatically save the ouput in a .JSON file using the same dir and naming convention as the charts. But with .JSON of course.

## Webull Hot Keys

- [X] Set up, shortcut keys!


## /newbie

- [X] Update molecules/telegram_polling.py: Add a new command /newbie.  This command is to display:
"**Welcome!**

Daytrading is frequently very fast.  In and out of a stock in ten minutes is common. I once made almost 9% in less than 90 seconds.

**Hot Keys**

Hot keys are a way to buy and sell quickly.  These are supported by Lightning Trader, Charles Schwab (Tos), and Webull.  See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hgpZMvCY08 for setup instructions.

**Scanner Commands**

'volume surge' and 'top gainers' function only after market open.  If before market open, the prior trading day results will be given.

**Best wishes!**"

## Top Gainers

- [X] VERY IMPORTANT:  Remember everything you did for 'volume surge'. And apply that to update molecules/telegram_polling.py: Any user can send the command 'top gainers' case insensitive. Respond to the command by running the Python script below.  The last line of the output will contain a filename of the form ./historical_data/YYYY-MM-DD/scanner/top_gainers_*.csv. Return the file contents to the user that sent the command. Add this to the /help command.  Use a timeout of 10 minutes.  This script takes a while to run.
```bash
python code/alpaca_screener.py  --exchanges NASDAQ AMEX  --max-symbols 7000  --min-price 0.75  --max-price 40.00  --min-volume 50000 --top-gainers 20 --export-csv top_gainers_nasdaq_amex.csv --verbose
```


## Relative Volume Surge

- [X] VERY IMPORTANT:  Update molecules/telegram_polling.py: Any user can send the command 'volume surge' case insensitive. Respond to the command by running the Python script below.  The last line of the output will contain a filename of the form ./historical_data/YYYY-MM-DD/scanner/relative_volume_*.csv. Return the file contents to the user that sent the command. Add this to the /help command.  Use a timeout of 10 minutes.  This script takes a while to run.
```bash
python code/alpaca_screener.py  --exchanges NASDAQ AMEX  --max-symbols 7000  --min-price 0.75  --max-price 40.00  --min-volume 50000 --min-percent-change 5.0  --surge-days 50  --volume-surge 5.0  --export-csv relative_volume_nasdaq_amex.csv  --verbose
```


## Halted Stocks Update

NOTE: This was done because false positive were being generated.
This give a person a chance to still trade false positive and even positives.
- [X] Stop filtering halted stocks at orb alert level.
- [X] Pass 'Halted' field through to trade_generator.py.
- [X] Update trade_generator.py to filter stock that have been halted.


## Halted Stocks

- [X] VERY IMPORTANT: Review code/orb_alert.py:  How is it filtering stocks?
- [X] VERY IMPORTANT: Update code/orb_alert.py:  Before the VWAP filter add a stock halted filter.  When a stock halts there is missing timestamps in the stock date.  Stock data is per minute.  So if there is more than a minute between timestamps, the stock halted.  Here is an example 2025-09-16 09:36:00 and 2025-09-16 09:42:00.


## Signal

- [X] VERY IMPORTANT: Create code/signal.py: 1) Read data/YYYYMMDD.csv using current date, 2) For each symbol in data/YYYYMMDD.csv, compare the signal field to the most recent 'low' value in historical_data/YYYY-MM-DD/market_data/[symbol]_YYYYMMDD_*.csv; where the historical data file is the most recent (there are at least two per symbol), A) If the 'low' value is at 95% or greater of the signal value, store the symbol, signal, and low value to a list. 3) Finally, print the list to std in csv format.
Example Files:  data/20250917.csv; historical_data/2025-09-17/market_data/ATCH_20250917_*.csv
Conform to repo standards.
Check linting compliance.
Check for VS Code integration errors.
Test.
- [X] VERY IMPORTANT:  Update molecules/telegram_polling.py: Any user can send the command 'signal' case insensitive. Respond to the command by running code/oracle_signal.py.  Return the output to the user that sent the command. Add this to the /help command.



## Negative Long Delta

- [X] Currently getting an error then autofix for a negative long delta.  This should not be an error.  Investigate.  Changed * 1.10 to + 0.02. I would have radically altered the alerts if left negative.  That value is used for penetration range calculation.  "Resistance" is major resistance and is very important.  I just set it to $0.02 above signal.

## Scanner

- [X] VERY IMPORTANT, think hard: Review the following CSV info. It is from a stock screen filter on my computer.  Review Alpaca Trading API version 2 for stock screening. Create specs/alpaca_screener.md with all the info necessary to write a stock screener. also add the ability to screen stocks for which the volume is up N times versus the last M days.

## Test Monitor Positions

- [ ] Do this in the paper account
- [ ] Test on Sat. if possible with AAPL
- [ ] Update the monitor to send a Telegram post to the account holder every 15 minutes
- [ ] Buy AAPL
- [ ] Verify the monitor works for this simple case
- [ ] Expand testing to include closing positions

## Trades Exponential Decay

- [ ] VERY IMPORTANT. Update atoms/alerts/trade_generator.py: Do an exponential decay on trades.

## Stock Review

- [ ] 2025-08-26 Did $HKPD take off very early.  Why not detected.



Work M/r into alters and not yet trades.




## EOD

- [X] IMPORTANT.  What does code/alerts_watch.py do at the end of the day?
- [X] VERY IMPORTANT.  How is atoms/alerts/trade_generator.py keeping track of trades per account-name and account? If so, use that information to create a list of unique account-name/account combinations.  Then get the alpaca.py --account-name <account name> --account <account> --PNL for each unique combination.  Also, send a Telegram post to Bruce for the PNL for each unique combination.  Both of those can be put inside the same loop.

## BLIND FLIGHT

- [X] VERY IMPORTANT. Do a root cause analysis.  Review sent superduper alerts. Why does the "MACD Technical Analysis" "Status" show "No live data available"? There should be data availble. It should be retrieved via the Alpaca API that is instantiated with the account-name Janice and account paper. !Current SIP data is not allowed.!
- [X] IMPORTANT. Update code/orb_alerts.py: It currently saves historically data every ten minutes. Change that to every minute.  Also, once the data is saved, delete the previous data for the symbol.
- [X] VERY IMPORTANT. The historical data files do have current data. Use that data to perform the "MACD Technical Analysis".
- [X] VERY IMPORTANT. Use the same data file to conduct the "Momentum Short" analysis in the "Trend Analysis" section.

## Trades

- [X] VERY IMPORTANT. Update atoms/alerts/trade_generator.py: It is currently not using --account-name and --account.  Does it know those values?  Update the alpaca.py call with those values.  Review code/alpaca.py parsing mechanism to determine the order of the args. Example: --account-name Bruce --account paper.
- [X] Why 15 trades?

- [ ] My trades place two orders.  Provide feedback in the Telegram post for both orders.

## MISC

- [X] Review README_MACD.md and also why am I getting Blind Flight in my alerts?
- [X] Update   Alert Timeframe: 20 minutes
- [X] Alert Green Threshold: 0.70




## Exit Strategy

- [X] VERY IMPORTANT. THINK HARD. I am collecting historical data on sent superduper alerts.  I plan to backtest my alerts under different         â”‚
â”‚   selling parameters. The ultimate goal is to maximize profit. My entrance strategy is based on the alerts.  I need to determine the optimal   â”‚
â”‚   exit strategy. When buying, I usually set a stop loss. I can set a take profit percent. I can set a trailing loss percent. I can let a MACD  â”‚
â”‚   criteria trigger the sell.  If the stock position does not sell by 15:40 ET, it is automatically closed.  The question is how to conduct     â”‚
â”‚   the statistic analysis to maximize profit while considering that some of the exit strategies overlap.  That is a take profit percent may or  â”‚
â”‚   may not prevent a MACD criteria from even being tested.  I am not concerned about when to liquidate at the end of the day.  And, what type   â”‚
â”‚   of statistical testing.                                                                                                                      â”‚

## Trades

- [X] Is VERB doubled again? Fix it.
- [O] Try to get trades into the analysis. No. Have PCA figure out what filters to apply.  Specifically TOD, Time of Day.

## errata

- [X] VERY IMPORTANT: the buy type for $BSLK was not correct. The trade execution responded with no but without detail.
- [X] Reduce the price momentum length. Reduce from 0.75 to 0.65 in atoms/alerts/config.py. Centralize the location of the price momentum in atoms/alerts/config.py to 20.

## Backtesting Update

- [X] VERY IMPORTANT. THINK HARD. We have been having difficults getting the processes in code/backtesting.py coordinated as to which directories to output their data. So, we are just going to keep them the same but with a twist.
Update code/backtesting.py to copy atoms/alerts/config_current_run.py to atoms/alerts/config.py at startup.  It is to copy atoms/alerts/config_orig.py to atoms/alerts/config.py at shutdown to include responding to a <CTRL+C>.
Every run will write to the same output directory.  At the end of the run use a Bash mv command to move the dir in the now updated config file to a dynamically named dir which is already in the code.
- [ ] Run verb by itself and see if 640 or 320.  Are the charts showing all three symbols? 2043 symbol pie chart shows three.

## Backtesting

- [X] Centralize the starting point for the historical_data dir in config.py. 2025-08-13 17:00
- [X] Create ./data/backtesting/symbols.json; populate with symbol/date/active='no' combos BSLK,2025-08-13; ATNF,2025-08-12; and STAI,2025-07-29. Then on 2025-08-04 the symbols OPEN, BTAI, and VERB.


- [X] Add --date arg to code/orb_alerts.py. Default to todays date.
- [X] Add --date arg to code/orb_alerts_monitor.py. Default to todays date.
- [X] VERY IMPORTANT. Centralize the starting point for the "logs" dir in atoms/alerts/config.py. It should be currently ./logs. Mirror historical root in atoms/alerts/config.py. Update the four scripts, code/orb_alerts.py, code/orb_alerts_monitor.py, code/orb_alerts_monitor_superduper.py, and code/orb_alerts_trade_stocks.py accordingly. For any script that does not use the logs dir, leave it unchanged.
- [X] VERY IMPORTANT. Centralize the starting point for the "data" dir in atoms/alerts/config.py. It should be currently ./data. Mirror historical root in atoms/alerts/config.py. Update code/orb_alerts.py.
- [X] VERY IMPORTANT. Centralize the starting point for the "plots" dir in atoms/alerts/config.py. It should be currently ./plots. Mirror historical root in atoms/alerts/config.py. Update code/alpaca.py.



- [X] VERY IMPORTANT. This is only a question.  Leave the code unchanged. How to create a data pipeline for code/orb_alerts.py? Perhaps read all the data for the symbol and date using pre-existing Alpaca scripts in this repo; then pipe in the data iteratively adding a minute (candlestick) at a time to replicate real-time processing.
- [X] Would you create a new CLI arg for alpaca.py or perhaps create a new script?
- [X] Create the new script.

api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=10,
    side='buy',
    type='trailing_stop',
    time_in_force='gtc',
    trail_percent='2'
)
7. Of course --submit is required for a real trade, otherwise it is a dry run
8. Update README_alpaca.md

- [X] Important. Think hard. Change --buy-trailing to --sell-trailing so side='sell'; Update README_alpaca.md of course; Replace the required --amount with --quantity which is required; Give an example of a market buy --amount with a matching --sell-trailing --quantity (you will have to fake the quantity).

Make the filtering an atom; the atom should be passed the path of the latest super alert which the watchdog will make available; the atom should look at all super alerts from the symbol on that day (the date will be in the path from the watchdog); the you are to design the filter logic for the superduper alert based upon the stock is rising in price or consolidating; pass a timeframe to the atom and have it default to 45 minutes; use the timeframe for the filter logic; you are to create a new message format that is to be sent on Telegram.

- [X] git switch -c opening_range
- [X] Think hard. Update code/orb.py: The code currently conducts PCA for a single date; Add --start and --end optional args;  do the old processing if the new args aren't there; if and only if both new args are there, do PCA analyis but do not generate charts; also add a new arg --opening-range, have it default to 15 which is probably what is in the current code.  Please do PCA across all dates in a single pass and not day-by-day.
- [X] Think hard. Create code/orb_analysis.py: This code is to repeatedly call code/orb.py with the date range in ./data and iterate from 10 to 30 by 5's; it is then to compare and contrast the results to determine the impact of the opening range. Put all the results in a single file.  Then I can run them through you separately.

- [X] Think. Update code/orb_alerts_monitor.py: Add the arg --post-only-urgent; update the call to send_orb_alert by adding a bool argument for the new CLI arg; send_orb_alert is to send telegram messages per this new arg; send_orb_alert sends only urgent methods if --post-only-urgent, otherwise send all messages.

- [X] cp code/orb_alerts.py code/orb_alerts_2.py; Integrate the atom atom/api/build_symbol_list.py into code/orb_alerts_2.py.
- [X] Update code/orb_alerts_2.py: After calculating the ORB, for each stock: if the "Signal" field is zero, set it to orb high.

- [X] Update code/orb_alerts_summary.py: Create bullish and bearish pie charts as well as bar charts for superduper alerts. All superduper alerts are high impact so it is not necessary to create a high impact chart.

- [X] Create new tag. v0.3.1 "Superduper Charts."
- [be careful that it doesn't ruin a good thing] Update code/orb_alerts_monitor_superduper.py: It is currently using 45 minutes for trend analisis; change it to 30 minutes.

- [X] Think hard. Create tests/backtesting/alerts_backtest.py; Create a backtest for code/orb_alerts.py; It is to have CLI args for symbol and date; use --date and --symbol as the names. This backtest will be kept in the repo.

- [X] Think hard. Create a PRD, specs/telegram_post_prd.md, to ceate Telegram atom to post messages to Telegram API. The atom needs to accept a message as a string and post it to Telegram. Use dotenv to retrieve Telegram keys or whatever.  Have a separate CSV containing users to which to post; the file name is to start with ".", be in the root dir, and added to .gitignore.

- [X] Update code/orb_alerts_summary.py: Create bullish and bearish bar charts for super alerts and bin ("current_price" / "orb_high") by increments of 10 percent.
- [X] Update code/orb_alerts_summary.py: Create additional bullish and bearish pie charts for super alerts that the current price is 20% above signal price for bullish alerts and vice versa.
- [X] Update code/orb_alerts_monitor.py: Only send messages to Telegram users after the filters have been applied.
- [X] Update code/orb_alerts_monitor.py: Send Telegram message as urgent if "original_alert": ("current_price" / "orb_high") >= 1.20; otherwise regular message.


- [X] Update atoms/api/parse_args.py to use "-" instead of "_" in argument names. Update README_alpace.md as appropriate.
- [X] Think hard. Review code/alpaca.py: Review _buy: it is a bracket order; however certain types of orders are not allowed in after hours trading; create a new method for after hours trading.
- [X] Think hard.  Is atoms/utils/parse_args.py only used by code/alpaca.py?  If so, move it to atoms/api with the other alpaca atoms.
- [ ] Think hard. Rename atoms/api to atoms/api_alpaca.


- [ ] Create specs/webull.md.
- [ ] Follow instructions in specs/webull.md to create a PRD specs/webull_prd.md. Think Hard.
- [X] Update code/orb_alerts.py to accept new symbols during the day. Due to other updates, just restart the script.  Have Claude add to exiting table.
- [X] Update code/alpaca.py: for --buy, add optional --amount; use amount to calculate number of shares; round shares to 0 decimal places.
- [X] Update code/alpaca.py: for --buy, add optional --stop_loss and use it when provided; add optional --calc_take_profit.  If --calc_take_profit, calculate it as (latest_quote - stop loss) * 1.5.  --calc_take_profit is only valid when used with --stop_loss so print a warning if used without --stop_loss.  Print warning if --calc_take_profit is used with --take_profit.
- [X] Update code/alpaca.py: for --buy, add optional --stop_loss and use it when provided; add optional --calc_take_profit.  If --calc_take_profit, calculate it as (latest_quote - stop loss) * 1.5.  --calc_take_profit is only valid when used with --stop_loss so print a warning if used without --stop_loss.  Print warning if --calc_take_profit is used with --take_profit.
- [X] Review code/alpaca.py: What CLI args can be combined with --buy
- [X] Update atoms/display/plot_candle_chart.py: Add a second Y axis; it is to be price / orb high.

- [X] Update code/alpaca.py: The return values of orders placed are not being checked.  Process all order return values and handle gracefully.
- [X] Git switch -c premarket_data
- [X] Update code/orb_alerts.py to collect data starting at 9:00 so EMA20 can be calculated at market open.  ORB is still 9:30 to 9:45.
- [X] No alerts in the last 15 minutes of the day.
- [X] You must source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate alpaca
- [X] Manually plot EMA20 and see if this would be an indicator to stop trading.
- [X] Update code/orb.py to plot EMA20.
- [X] Review: does code/orb_alerts.py have EMA9 and EMA20?
- [X] Update code/orb_alerts.py to include EMA9, EMA20, and the new technical indicators in the alert.
- [X] Update code/orb_alerts_monitor.py to filter out EMA9 below EMA20 for bullish alerts.
- [X] Update code/orb_alerts_history.py to filter out EMA9 below EMA20 for bullish alerts.
- [X] Update code/orb_alerts_monitor.py to filter out stocks that the current low is below EMA9 for bullish alerts.
- [X] Update code/orb_alerts_history.py to filter out stocks that the current low is below EMA9 for bullish alerts.
- [X] Update code/orb.py to plot super alerts instead of alerts.
- [X] Update the analysis software to handle bearish alerts correctly.
- [X] Turn Claude loose at improving ORB alert.
- [X] Stop printing "INFO - Cleaned up" notifications on deleting historical data.
- [X] Update plot candle sticks to accept optional alerts.
- [ ] Update code/orb.py: Accept a date arg; accept an optional symbol arg; combine alerts; plot
- [ ] Update code/orb_alerts.py to keep only the latest historical data file per symbol.  Implement this when saving more data.
- [ ] Create method to add more stocks to the alerts.
- [ ] Update orb chart to take optional bullish and bearish data.
- [ ] Update orb chart to take optional s/r lines.
- [ ] Accumulate stock data in a single file per stock per day.
- [ ] Fix Phase 3 startup it is currently bypassed
- [ ] Update alpaca.py to take .env as argument.
- [X] atoms.monitoring.performance_tracker - WARNING - High memory usage: 82.3%
- [ ] Update to do trailing stop. Create new method UStrailingStop()
- [ ] Check the return values of orders.
- [X] Focus on creating ORB filter.
- [X] Finish establishing the PCA data.
- [ ] Create some more ORB PyTests.
- [X] Create some more ORB PyTests.
- [X] Create some ORB PyTests.
- [X] ORB Create VWAP atom.
- [X] ORB Create EMA with 9 as the default parameter atom.
- [ ] ORB Create atom to calculate a momentum vector from ORB candlesticks.  Hmm. Is this two values? Yes.  Fit a line and use the angle.
